All code for Catch a Brainrot, me and @bigrahim's open source roblox game!
This code contains a bunch of helpful scripts for making roblox games in similar genres or even vastly different genres.
While I cannot speak for bigrahim, I did not use any AI in the creation of this game.
Here is a summary of semi-universal features:
Pathfinding Algorithm
Helpful leaderstats like cash and rebirth
Weather cycling system
Platform Money Collection
Admin Menus
Flying Scripts (only used for admins in our game)
Gui self organizer
and...
✨Full export script that reduces 2.7gb of .lua to a neatly formatted, indexed, dictionaried .txt file that takes up 712 kb, and 85 when g-zipped!✨
note export only works on windows as it uses powershell.
