All code for Catch a Brainrot, me and @bigrahim's open source roblox game!<br>
This code contains a bunch of helpful scripts for making roblox games in similar genres or even vastly different genres.<br>
While I cannot speak for bigrahim, I did not use any AI in the creation of this game.<br>
Here is a summary of semi-universal features:<br>
Pathfinding Algorithm<br>
Helpful leaderstats like cash and rebirth<br>
Weather cycling system<br>
Platform Money Collection<br>
Admin Menus<br>
Flying Scripts (only used for admins in our game)<br>
Automatic Gui organizer<br>
and...<br>
✨Full export script that reduces 2.7gb of .lua to a neatly formatted, indexed, dictionaried .txt file that takes up 712 kb, and 85 when g-zipped!✨<br>
note export only works on windows as it uses powershell.<br>
